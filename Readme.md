 - <a href='https://https://t.me/Diagnosis_Flower_bot'>bot telegram</a>
   I use a free host to upload and run my code on it so not to need run this file on your system to use telegram bot.
   This telegram bot has some commands that I wrote them befor and now I add /image command. After send this command, you should send a flower picture and the bot is predicting the name your flower.

The file which name is `Flowersbot.py` is made for creating a telegram bot. You can access this telegram bot with this name:
   @NEW_pylearn_bot
